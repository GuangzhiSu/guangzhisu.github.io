I’m Guangzhi (Allen) Su, a senior in the Duke–Duke Kunshan dual-degree program majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science. I work with Prof. Kaizhu Huang (Signature Work) and as a research intern with Profs. Yiran Chen and Neil Zhenqiang Gong.

My research focuses on algorithms for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially efficiency and robustness. Recent projects span video MLLMs and clinical adverse-event detection, autoregressive image generation, and agentic systems.
