I'm Guangzhi (Allen) Su, a senior in the Dukeâ€“Duke Kunshan dual-degree program majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science. I work with Prof. [Kaizhu Huang](https://faculty.dukekunshan.edu.cn/faculty_profiles/kaizhu-huang) (Signature Work) from [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/) and as a research intern with Profs. [Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/people/yiran-chen/) and [Neil Zhenqiang Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/) from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/).

My research focuses on algorithms for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially efficiency and robustness. Recent projects span video MLLMs and clinical adverse-event detection, autoregressive image generation, and agentic systems. I'm looking forward to work on directions along with the current work, as well as AI applications in different domain such as healthcare.
