This project develops a **YouTube Video Crawler** - a professional Python tool for systematically scraping and downloading YouTube videos. The crawler addresses the challenge of efficiently collecting large-scale video datasets from YouTube for research, content analysis, and educational purposes.

## Project Overview

The YouTube Video Crawler implements a comprehensive solution for automated video collection with three main components:

### Core Functionality
- **Video Scraping**: Automated extraction of video metadata and URLs from YouTube search results
- **Authentication Support**: Cookie-based authentication for accessing restricted or age-restricted content
- **Batch Download**: Efficient downloading of multiple videos with configurable quality settings

### Key Features
- **Infinite Scroll Handling**: Automatically manages YouTube's dynamic content loading
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of scraping and download progress
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of network issues and failed operations
- **Configurable Parameters**: Customizable search queries, download formats, and batch sizes

## Technical Implementation

The project utilizes **Selenium** for web automation, **yt-dlp** for video downloading, and implements a modular architecture with separate components for cookie management, video scraping, and download processing. The system supports both authenticated and anonymous access modes, making it suitable for various use cases.

## Impact

This tool provides researchers, content creators, and developers with a reliable solution for systematic YouTube content collection. The crawler's ability to handle large-scale data extraction while maintaining robust error handling makes it valuable for academic research, content analysis, and educational dataset creation.

The project demonstrates practical expertise in web scraping, browser automation, and Python development, offering a professional-grade solution for YouTube data collection challenges.
